## Project Purpose
Three of the most popular stock analysis methods are technical, fundamental, and sentimental analysis.  Perhaps Machine Learning can be used to remove the human element from these methods of analysis.  For fundamental analysis, classification models were used to determine if a stock would be a Buy, Sell, or Hold.  For technical analysis, time series models were used to forecast the general direction of the stock price.  For sentiment analysis, NLP tools were used such as NLTK's VADER to determine the public's opinion and feeling towards a stock.  The hope would be that these machine learning models would enhance and improve the current methods of analysis.
